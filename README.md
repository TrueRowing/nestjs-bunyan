# `@eropple/nestjs-bunyan` #
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40eropple%2Fnestjs-bunyan.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40eropple%2Fnestjs-bunyan)

This package contains a module to provide Bunyan logging across a NestJS
application. It supports full request-specific logging by providing a
request-scoped Bunyan logger in the dependency injector and includes an
in/out interceptor for recording request data and request timing.

## Recent Changes ##
### 0.3.0 ###
- Documented available options more deeply.
- Added a `staticLogger` option. When true, the `LOGGER` key (and the
  `@Logger()` decoration) injects the same thing as `ROOT_LOGGER`, making
  it easier to use NestJS logging outside of an HTTP context.

## Installation ##
`yarn add @eropple/nestjs-bunyan` or `npm install --save @eropple/nestjs-bunyan`
depending on your package manager of choice.

## Usage ##
`@eropple/nestjs-bunyan` expects you to define a Bunyan logger somewhere in your
application--a global, a logger via ConfigService, whatever makes the most sense
for your application.

Import it at the root of your application:

```ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { LoggingModule } from "@eropple/nestjs-bunyan";

import { ROOT_LOGGER } from './logger';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';

@Module({
  imports: [
    LoggingModule.forRoot(ROOT_LOGGER, {})
  ],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

This will do a few things:

- It **adds the root logger to the DI container**. You can get it with the
  `@RootLogger()` decorator on your constructor parameter. (You can use this
  with `Scope.DEFAULT` injected services.)
- It **adds the request logger to the DI container**. This logger includes the
  request's correlation ID with every log entry. You can get it with the
  `@Logger()` decorator on your constructor parameter. You must only use this
  with `Scope.REQUEST` injected services (and NestJS should transitively make
  anything that depends on `@Logger()` a request-scoped provider automatically.)

**Important note:** this module expects a request to have some kind of
[correlation ID](). By default, this will be `X-Correlation-Id` (and if you need
to inject that, might I recommend [@eropple/nestjs-correlation-id]()?), but you
can change it to, for example, `X-Request-Id`, by passing something like
`correlationIdHeader: "X-Request-Id"` to the options in
`LoggingModule.forRoot()`.

### Request Tracking ###
`@eropple/nestjs-bunyan` also includes a request tracking middleware that
records into the log the start and end of every request coming into your server.
The start log entry includes all request headers; the end log entry includes the
time taken with the request and the status code. You can use these, plus the
correlation ID, to determine overall request timings.

The implementation is currently a little tortured (to write, not to use), so
it's implemented a little differently than normal. Use it a-like so:

```ts
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.use(CorrelationIdMiddleware());
  LoggingModule.addRequestMiddleware(app);

  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

The request middleware records timing in milliseconds, so it _probably_ doesn't
matter too much where in your middleware chain you do it, but it's probably best
to put it as early in the process as possible, immediately behind whatever
middleware is ensuring that you have a working correlation ID.


### Controller Example ###
```ts
import * as Bunyan from "bunyan";
import { Controller, Get, Scope } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Logger } from "@eropple/nestjs-bunyan";

import { AppService } from './app.service';

@Controller({ scope: Scope.REQUEST })
export class AppController {
  private readonly _logger: Bunyan;

  constructor(
    @Logger() requestLogger: Bunyan,
    private readonly appService: AppService
  ) {
    this._logger = requestLogger.child({ component: this.constructor.name });
  }

  @Get()
  getHello(): Promise<string> {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      this._logger.info("getHello hit; pausing.");

      setTimeout(() => {
        this._logger.info('getHello done!');
        resolve(this.appService.getHello());
      }, 1000)
    })
  }
}
```

And some sample output, when passed through the `bunyan` executable:
